- I participated in the research as the co-first author. The article is published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics(SCI, IF=3.702, CCF B, DOI: 10.1109/TCBB.2019.2949780)
- With mutual information and the Bayesian method, we aim to predict the interactions between genes (epistasis).
- The article was awarded as one of the "Top Ten Innovations and Entrepreneurship Projects" (university level) in 2019.
